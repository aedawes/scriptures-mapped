# The Scriptures, Mapped

This is a project in progress. This project will show a visual web representation of each location mentioned in the King James Version of the Bible as well as other texts used by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. The data for this project is pulled from a database maintained by Dr. Steven Liddle at Brigham Young University.
