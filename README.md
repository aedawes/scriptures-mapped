# Homework 5

It has been a long time since I did any javascript/functional webpage without using a front end framework such as Vue.js or React.js. When I did do something like this in the past, it was never as in depth as I was just learning so there was no need to access a backend or database of any kind. This assignment was a great refresher on how to use javascript to create a functional webpage and to query using ajax. I read more in depth into ajax and about callbacks because it had been a while since I had used them. I learned a lot more about ajax, callbacks, and how to write a clean JS file as the main benefits from this assignment.
